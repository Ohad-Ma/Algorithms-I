/**
 * Problem:
 * We were given an N size array which contains values such that:
 *  - Every cell in the array contains a Cop or A Burglar
 *  - Every cop can capture only one burglar
 *  - Cop cannot capture burglar which is being found in a distance bigger than K cells from it.
 * 
 * We have to find the maximal amount of burglars that we can capture.
 * 
 * Solution:
 * 1) Find the lowest index where Cop is being found - p, and the lowest index where Burglar is found - t
 * 2) If (|p-t| <= k) : 
 *      Pair(p,t)
 *      increment p,t indexes to the next Cop and Burglar cells
 * 3) Else:
 *      Increment the min(p,t) idx to the next one.
 *      Do over 2 last steps.
 * 
 * 4) return the amount of pairs.
 * 
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(N) 
 * 
 * Algorithm:
    1. Initialize the current lowest indices of policeman in pol and thief in thi variable as -1.
    2 Find the lowest index of policeman and thief.
    3 If lowest index of either policeman or thief remain -1 then return 0.
    4 If |pol â€“ thi| <=k then make an allotment and find the next policeman and thief.
    5 Else increment the min(pol , thi) to the next policeman or thief found.
    6 Repeat the above two steps until we can find the next policeman and thief.
    7 Return the number of allotments made.
