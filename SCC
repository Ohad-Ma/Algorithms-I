How to find Strong connected components?
SCC(G):
    1) call DFS(G) to compute finishing times f[u] for all u 
    
    2) compute G^T (transposed graph)
    
    3) call DFS(G^T), but in the main loop, consider vertices in order
       of decreasing f[u] (as computed in first DFS)

    4) output the vertices in each tree of the depth-first forest
       formed in second DFS as sperate SCC

Running time: O(|V|+|E|)
